# problem-sets-latex

This repository contains the LaTeX source files for all documents in "Problem Set" section of my personal website. All documents were originally written with Overleaf, but imported here for easier organization and sharing.

## Notes
For anyone new to LaTeX, please do not treat the sources as your ideal reference. Some of the documents are older and may not follow consistent LaTeX style or best practices. Moreover, many of my solutions were written when I first started learning to use LaTeX and write competition-style solutions.

There are much better solutions and tex formats out there. I am making this collection public mainly in case someone finds them useful including TikZ codes.

Comments and Feedback are welcomed :)) Enjoy!!
